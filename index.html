       <p>The Business Technology Management (BTM) program combines both business and IT concepts, to prepare me in many industries when managing technical projects and creating effective solutions using technology to address business needs. </p>
       
       <h2x>Most Useful Course</h2x>
       <p>The course I found most useful is <strong> ITM618 (Business Intelligence and Analytics).</strong> This course provided me a strong foundation of business intelligence, including the development and the use of data warehouses, datamarts and different machine learning algorithms through course content, Python labs, and statistical projects. In simple terms, it deepens your understanding on business decision-making through analytics. </p>

Meta tags, such as the description tag, help in boosting visibility and making the page appear more inviting in search results. These tags enhance a page's relevance and encourage users to click by providing a concise description of the website's purpose. By including specific keywords and descriptions, meta tags increase the chances of ranking higher on search engine results.</td>
