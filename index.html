They are basically a form of keywords that provide search engines with relevant date to help users understand the type of content the webpage is related to prior to clicking on it (Moz, n.d.). This can slowly increase the click-through rates, by engaging more user interest and ultimately improve website visibility and drive more traffic. In my website, I implemented meta tags by adding some code for the description, keywords and the viewport in the HTML code. </td>

                   <td>Page titles are another important SEO technique, as they are prominently displayed on search engine result pages. A well-crafted title with relevant keywords can improve the likelihood of users visiting the page. Titles also help search engines understand the context and content of each webpage, supporting improved ranking for appropriate searches.Keywords is another SEO technique that is used to improve ranking for specific items when searched. They are placed between the headings, metadata and the content. For example, if a user decides to enter a query on a website, the keyword analyzes that query and derives relevant content which targets the user needs. This increases the volumes of traffic on the website, and makes it more likely the website will appear on the search engine (SitePoint, n.d.). Moreover, keywords are an effective tool that retains traffic and helps a website remain relevant. </td>

When other sites connect to a page, search engines use this technique by mutually trusting the website, which improves website rankings (Bruce Clay, n.d.). This leads to higher search results, and useful for when building personal portfolios or blog pages, as it is being referred by a trustworthy website. </td>

When users click on the like button, it shares the content on the user’s Facebook network, which reaches a wider audience and has the potential to increase website traffic (Lockard, 2014). This increases user engagement, since users are more likely to navigate through websites that other people have scrolled on or used before. For personal portfolios, this builds credibility and is a way of building your social brand through social media channels.

This can help your website reach out to a younger audience and help your website remain consistent.

The Twitter sharing button has sharing capabilities, that users can click on to reshare a specific tweet that they want to share to their followers or publicly. Twitter users can then engage further with the tweet by replying to the content, or even resharing the tweet (Bhargava, 2010). This can generate discussions in regards to the website content. For instance, in a website portfolio, hiring professionals can make certain comments about the website and may give some useful feedback and insights. Overall, the Twitter Sharing button It is a cycle of user engagement and virtual communication through social media platforms.</td>
