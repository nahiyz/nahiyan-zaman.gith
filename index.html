        <h2>About My Program</h2>
        <p>The Business Technology Management (BTM) program combines both business and IT concepts, to prepare me in many industries when managing technical projects and creating effective solutions using technology to address business needs. </p>
        
        <h2x>Most Useful Course</h2x>
        <p>The course I found most useful is <strong> ITM618 (Business Intelligence and Analytics).</strong> This course provided me a strong foundation of business intelligence, including the development and the use of data warehouses, datamarts and different machine learning algorithms through course content, Python labs, and statistical projects. In simple terms, it deepens your understanding on business decision-making through analytics. </p>
